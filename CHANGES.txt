0.3.3 (2010-01-13)
------------------

- Use a function instead of a metaclass to instrument Entity classes with
  member_name and related class attributes. Replace usage of EntityMeta with
  instrument_class (from restler.entity).
- Upgraded SQLAlchemy from 0.5.6 to 0.5.7
- Upgraded decorator from 3.0.1 to 3.1.2


0.3.2 (2009-12-15)
------------------

- When redirecting to a member, allow original request parameters to be
  relayed to the redirect and also allow arbitrary extra params to be passed
  to the redirect.


0.3.1 (2009-12-10)
------------------

- Bumped SQLAlchemy from 0.5.5 to 0.5.6.
- Fixed small bug in JSON rendering--use `wrap` arg passed to method that
  creates object to be JSONified instead of always using `self.wrap`. When
  making the call to that method, pass a `wrap` value.

0.3.0 (2009-11-06)
------------------

- Totally revamped relative to 0.2 series. Tries to flexibly support all
  kinds of WS queries, filtering, limits, distinct, etc.
- Supports Pylons 0.9.7 and friends (probably does not work well with Pylons
  0.9.6).
- Thinking about removing templates--i.e., removing all the admin interface
  aspects and focusing just on the lower level controller aspect. All that
  other stuff could be moved to Restin (unmaintained) or just discarded.
- Added Restler-controller-friendly entity (AKA model) base class.
- Added @privileged decorator.
- Manage releases with zest.releaser.
- No longer handles database connectivity (less magical).

Ancient History
---------------

* 2007-08-13 -- Removed the MyProject sample Pylons project
* Extracted from byCycle repo at r776 and moved to Google Code
* Removed `execfile` wonkiness in favor of importing restler then calling its
  new `init_model` function (wlb 2007-04-17)
* Added restler.options dict, similar to elixir's global options
  (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added a class factory to generate `RestController`s that are aware of a
  specific model; this replaces setting a global `model` (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added pagination support for collections (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Allow the parent model module to be different from the resource's model
  module by adding a keyword arg to `BaseController` function and using that
  model (if given) instead of the resource's model.
* Note whether a resource has a foreign key pointer to its parent
* Allow entities to be selected by "alternate IDs"; if an entity class
  defines the list `alternate_id`, those IDs will be tried when finding an
  object in the database
* In all nav helpers and templates, instead of using named routes to generate
  URLs, set `controller`, `action`, etc as necessary. This allows the helpers
  to also be used in the case where RESTful routes are created manually (i.e.,
  using `map.connect`) without names. Although this sounds harder to do (it's
  a little more manual), I was able to move several lines of code and some
  superfluous logic. (wlb 2007-04-23)
* Updated `_get_json_content` to use `to_builtin` instead of `__simplify__`
  (wlb 2007-04-26)
* Fixed some bugs in helper `nav_list_for_resource` relating to parent args for
  nav list creation: 1) When I factored out `nav_list_for_parent`, some vars
  were moved that were still being referenced 2) The parent list was being
  *added* to the result list instead of *appended* (wlb 2007-04-27)
