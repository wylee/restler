SVN
* 2007-08-13 -- Removed the MyProject sample Pylons project
* Extracted from byCycle repo at r776 and moved to Google Code
* Removed `execfile` wonkiness in favor of importing restler then calling its
  new `init_model` function (wlb 2007-04-17)
* Added restler.options dict, similar to elixir's global options
  (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added a class factory to generate `RestController`s that are aware of a
  specific model; this replaces setting a global `model` (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added pagination support for collections (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Allow the parent model module to be different from the resource's model
  module by adding a keyword arg to `BaseController` function and using that
  model (if given) instead of the resource's model.
* Note whether a resource has a foreign key pointer to its parent
* Allow entities to be selected by "alternate IDs"; if an entity class
  defines the list `alternate_id`, those IDs will be tried when finding an
  object in the database
* In all nav helpers and templates, instead of using named routes to generate
  URLs, set `controller`, `action`, etc as necessary. This allows the helpers
  to also be used in the case where RESTful routes are created manually (i.e.,
  using `map.connect`) without names. Although this sounds harder to do (it's
  a little more manual), I was able to move several lines of code and some
  superfluous logic. (wlb 2007-04-23)
* Updated `_get_json_content` to use `to_builtin` instead of `__simplify__` 
  (wlb 2007-04-26)
* Fixed some bugs in helper `nav_list_for_resource` relating to parent args for
  nav list creation: 1) When I factored out `nav_list_for_parent`, some vars 
  were moved that were still being referenced 2) The parent list was being
  *added* to the result list instead of *appended* (wlb 2007-04-27)
