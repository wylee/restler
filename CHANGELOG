SVN
* Extracted from byCycle repo at r776 and moved to Google Code
* Removed `execfile` wonkiness in favor of importing restler then calling its
  new `init_model` function (wlb 2007-04-17)
* Added restler.options dict, similar to elixir's global options
  (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added a class factory to generate `RestController`s that are aware of a
  specific model; this replaces setting a global `model` (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Added pagination support for collections (wlb 2007-04-22)
* Allow the parent model module to be different from the resource's model
  module by adding a keyword arg to `BaseController` function and using that
  model (if given) instead of the resource's model.
* Note whether a resource has a foreign key pointer to its parent
* Allow entities to be selected by "alternate IDs"; if an entity class
  defines the list `alternate_id`, those IDs will be tried when finding an
  object in the database
